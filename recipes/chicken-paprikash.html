      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Chicken Paprikash is a dish of Hungarian origin, the name coming from the large amount of paprika that defines the dish. It is a simple dish and one with many regional varieties. This page will feature my family's recipe, which can be served with egg noodles or mashed potatoes.</p>
